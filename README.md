# TTAppleMapsActivity

`TTAppleMapsActivity` is a `UIActivity` subclass that provides the possibility to open an address in Apple Maps. `TTAppleMapsActivity` uses the URL-Scheme defined by [Apple](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#featuredarticles/iPhoneURLScheme_Reference/Articles/MapLinks.html).

## Used In

- Please tell me if you use `TTAppleMapsActivity` in your App (just submit it as an [issue](https://github.com/honkmaster/TTAppleMapsActivity/issues))! 

## Requirements

- As `UIActivity` is iOS 6 only, so is the subclass.
- This project uses ARC. If you want to use it in a non ARC project, you must add the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag to TTAppleMapsActivity.m in Target Settings > Build Phases > Compile Sources.

## Installation

Add the `TTAppleMapsActivity` subfolder to your project. There are no required libraries other than `UIKit`.

## Usage.

Coming soon.
